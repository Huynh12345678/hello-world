My First Repository 
I love programming, I want to become a Super Developer. When i was 6 years old i have dream that a few years later, i will be the best of the world's programmer. Maybe i was so confident, althought my english is very bad. But not so that, i'm really tired when have to learn too much of knowledge for something subjects are too bullshit. And i was realized one thing that is my passion, I going to fight for my future and Family's future. I am Killer Clown, I like watching films about science, I also like playing video game. Sometimes, I also listen to music for kill the time. Hey what's up everyone all on the world, i'm sure that i will conquer all of programing language. Let's look it !!!
